A group calling itself the Croatian Nationalist Army is suspected to be responsible for the assassination, but it is unclear whether or not the claim was confirmed.  However, the letters sent to Yugoslav immigrants were signed by this group.  Additionally, it is unclear whether the letters may have been sent by the Yugoslav secret police in efforts to discredit the Croatian separatist movement, as some American-Croatian community leaders believe to be the case. This incident is linked to the firebombing, about a week later,  of a shop in Chicago, owned by an American of Croatian descent (197810040004) as well as the murder of another American of Croatian descent, Krizan Brkic, in California, who has also received a similar threatening letter (197811220002). In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called ""Otpor,"" or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States. A ninth man was later arrested and indicted as an associate of the other eight responsible for the abovementioned incidents. Those indicted included Mile Markic (the alleged leader of Otpor in the U.S.), Mile Boban (the alleged president of Otpor in North America), Ante Ljubas, Andjelko Jakic (former vice president of the New York chapter of the group), Ivan Misetic (former vice president of the Chicago chapter),  Vinko Logarusic (leader of the Cleveland chapter), Ranko Primorac (leader of the Los Angeles chapter), Miro Biosic (treasurer of the L.A. chapter), and Drago Sudar (the associate of the other eight members of the group).
