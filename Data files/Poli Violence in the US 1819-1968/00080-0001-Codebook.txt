     Data contained in this study deal with incidents of political and social        
     violence in the United States from 1819 to 1968, originally collected by        
     Professor Sheldon G. Levy of Wayne State University in connection with the      
     National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence (established       
     1968). The information contained in this file was gathered from a newspaper     
     sample, and includes variables such as date of the violent event, numbers of    
     deaths and injuries resulting from the events, and motivation or reasons for    
     the attack or violent event.

                                       Introduction                                  
                                       ------------                                  
                                                                                     
          This data set, which contains information about "politically violent       
     events" in the United States from 1851 through 1968, was generated in the       
     course of a research project conducted by Sheldon G. Levy. The unit of          
     analysis is an event. A sample of 869 violent events was drawn from             
     randomly-selected issues of two newspapers. From 1819 through 1850 four         
     issues of the Washington (D.C.) National Intelligence were selected each month; 
     from 1851 through 1899 four issues of the New York Times were selected each     
     month; and from 1900 through 1968 two issues of the New York Times were         
     selected each month. All politically violent incidents found in the selected    
     issues were coded. A weight variable, constructed by ICPR, has been included so 
     that variable frequencies may be adjusted with respect to the number of issues  
     sampled.                                                                        
                                                                                     
          Politically violent events were defined as those involving an attack on an 
     official or group of officials for any reason or an attack on an individual or  
     group of individuals for political or social reasons. Three indices of          
     political violence were used: the number of violent events; the number of       
     deaths resulting from the events; and the number of injuries resulting from the 
     events. Additional data collected include: data of event; nature of target;     
     number of attackers; level of violence by attacker; violence by a group of      
     attackers; motivation or reasons for attack; injury to target; property damage; 
     injury to attacker; type of attacker; and number of pages in newspaper issue.   
                                                                                     
          An initial statistical analysis of the data has been published as Sheldon  
     Levy, "A 150-Year Study of Political Violence in the United States," in         
     Violence in America, Historical and Comparative Perspectives by Hugh Davis      
     Graham and Ted Robert Gurr. A more extensive analysis may be found in A Staff

                               collection process (see Introduction). All events     
                               occurring from 1819 through 1899 were given a weight  
                               value of 1.0, and all events occurring from 1900      
                               through 1968 were given a weight value of 2.2. The
